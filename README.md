# SpringBoot-SwaggerExamples

Repository made for the purpose of educational teaching of Swagger features in SpringBoot manner.

The root of this repository contains multiple Spring Boot projects that sever different purposes for this topic. So if you need them to run them locally on your PC following the instructions from each of their directory will make your life easy, choose not to do this and it may take a few seconds more :)

**Remember**: "*Good Swagger Documentation is an essential ingredient of building good Spring Boot Microservices.*"



    So let’s start with the famous question **Swagger** vs **OpenAPI**:

> Although the terms once referred to the same thing, they can no longer be used interchangeably…even though some people still do. In 2021, **OpenAPI refers to the industry-standard specification for RESTful API design. Swagger refers to a set of SmartBear tools**. — [https://nordicapis.com/](https://nordicapis.com/whats-the-difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/#:~:text=Although%20the%20terms%20once%20referred,a%20set%20of%20SmartBear%20tools)



    To better understand this kind of political things I like to create timelines, so I made this timelines based on my weeks of research (if something is wrong please feel free to comment bellow as it helps us all to publish articles/tutorial/etc. that are more useful and true to the meaning)



- Swagger is a language-agnostic specification, meaning that it can be used with any programming language
- Swagger is a RESTful API specification, meaning that it can be used to document APIs that follow the REST architectural style
- Swagger is not a replacement for documentation, meaning that it should be used in addition to other forms of documentation such as user manuals and tutorials



I divide this repository made for the medium article in the following projects:
